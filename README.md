# Video Duration Manipulator
This small tool visually manipulates video length to trick people on social medias.

## What is it?
Have you ever seen videos with weird timeline? Well, you can "make" these video by editing their hexadecimal values, however you need to know how to convert bytes and constantly check the mp4/webm documentation in order to edit the correct ones. I eased all that hard work for you, just download my tool and you can make videos **visually** longer or shorter with few clicks; a good way to trick people around the web.

## How to use it
Just download the latest [release](https://github.com/Odex64/Video-Duration-Manipulator/releases) and run my program with `java -jar manipulator.jar` and follow the instructions.

## More
I'll add more features and .webm support as time passes, and eventually turn my program into a Swing application.
