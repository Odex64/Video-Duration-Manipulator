# Video-Duration-Manipulator
This small tool visually manipulates video length to trick people on social medias.

## What is it?
Have you ever seen videos with weird timeline? Well, this tool can easily manipulate it and make your video **visually* longer or shoter.

## How to use it
Just download the latest [release](https://github.com/Odex64/Video-Duration-Manipulator/releases) and run my program with `java -jar manipulator.jar` and follow the instructions.

## More
I'll add more features and .webm support as time passes, and eventually turn my program into a Swing application.
